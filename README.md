** Designer's Log: Day 10  **
---

Skillshare1 is a repo housing my very first coding project: a simple My Recipes webpage.

It is the first of three projects in a Skillshare course I'm taking on CSS and HTML. I coded it from scratch. That's right... from scratch!

This project also represents my first attempt at using Git/GitHub all by myself. (Disclaimer: my buddy gave me a crash course during which I executed my first commit and push. This time I rode solo.)

This may seem like child's play for even amateur devs, but this is quite the moment of celebration for this designer as code is not my primary medium.

So, yay!
